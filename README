# Critter Simulation

## Overview
The Critter Simulation project is a Java-based application developed as part of the Master in Information Technology program's course in Software Design and Development. This project simulates an ecosystem with various animal-like entities, known as 'critters', each with unique behaviors and interaction patterns within a virtual grid.

## Features
- Multiple critter types including Bears, Tigers, WhiteTigers, Giants, and NinjaCats.
- Behaviors such as movement, interaction, infection, and text-based communication implemented for each critter type.
- A graphical user interface for real-time observation of the critter behaviors.
- Demonstrates concepts of object-oriented programming, including inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.

## Getting Started
